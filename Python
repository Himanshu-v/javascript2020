Section 3 : Stepping into the world of python. 

 16 -Introduction: Guido Van Rossum
 
 Python is an OO, multi-platform (linux, mac, windows), interpreted language. Named after comedy show - Monty python's flying circus.
 It supports all basic data types and also some complex ones such as lists and dictionary.
 Supports all type of programming paradigms. PP FP OOP.
 Data in py is strongly typed. Also it is dynamically typed in terms of assignment.
 
 17 - First Code.
 
 18 - Printing in python:   
 
 print() function can take multiple arguments of same/different type.    
 
 
 19 Strings:
 
 ~Literal means value of some type - numeric literal, string literals.
 ~input() funtions is used to enter the values from keyboard.
 ~for strings we can use '' as well as "".
 
 20 - Escape Character \
 
 ~\n - new line
 ~\t - tab
 ~\ to ecsape ' " or any special char in the string.  
 ~ """ """ no need to use escape character between tripple quotes. TQ is alse used to print the string over multiple lines without using \n.
 
 21 - More Escape Character in String:
 
 ~ In order to ecape \ in a string use one more \ before it. Or use the prefix 'r' before the quoted string to mark it as a Raw String.
  
 22 - Variables and types:  
 
 ~variable is a meaningful name given to a certain area of memory address which can store the values for computational/display purpose.
 ~type() gives the type of variable passed in as agrument. 

 23 - Strongly typed language:  
 
 ~ cannot combine/add/concate two different datatypes. No automatic type conversion.
 
 24 - Pythons numeric data types: 
 
 ~Sevaral built-in datatypes in py:- numeric, iterater, sequence, mapping, file, class, exception.
 ~Numeric: int, float, complex.  long in p2 is replaced in p3 as in p3 int has no size limit. for storing large no. at all.
 ~Python float has max 308 places after the decimal point, and minimun 308 digits before dec point. Float has 52 digits of precision. Decimal has more.
 
 25 - Numeric operators:
 ~ + - / *, // - integer division(no dec point in results)
