Section 2 : /JS Fundamentals. (only important chapters)

 8 -/ Breif intro to JS:  
  ~High level (we don't have to worry about comlex stuff like memory management and concurrency - abstraction)
  ~Object oriented -based on objects for storing most kind of data.
  ~Multi paradigm - coded in different styles.
  ~Programming language - set of instruction to the computer.						
  ~ Used to -  add features to a web page, make web pages dynamic and reactive, dom manipulation.
  ~Front end web app - Angular, React; Backend - NodeJs; Mobile application - React Native; 	
  ~There's nothing JS cannot do.
  ~Releases - ES2015 -> ES6   (EcmaScript)
					

 9  -/ Linking external JS file. - Usually at the end of the body tag.
 10 -/ Variable and values - Value is the smallest unit of info in js, variable is a container/name given to memory location which stores that value for reusability.
  
 ~Conventions to name a variable - No reserved keyword, should be descriptive, should not start with number and special symbols except $ and _. 
 
 11 -/ Data Types.  
 
 ~A value can be object or primitives.   Primitives: Number (always floating point no. All numbers are just numbers) String,  boolean, undefined (default value), null, symbols, BigInt.
 ~JS is dynamically typed.
 
 12 -/ let const var in JS:   let and const were introduced in ES6.
 
 ~let - mutable. default value is undefined
 ~const - immutable. Initializing is must. 
 ~var - older way of declaring variables
 
 14 -/  Basic operators: 
 ~Math : +-*%, Logical - <>= etc.;  ++ --  grouping()
 15 -/ Operator precedence - MDN 
 
 17 -/ String and Template literals.
 
 ~can be in '' or ""
 ~multi line string is very easy.
 
 18 -/ if else.  
 ~Conditionals to tell what part of the code to execute based on some coditions.
