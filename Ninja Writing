Section 1: Introduction.  
 Elements of good writing - Simplicity, clarity and Integrity. 

Section 2 : Narratives.

 4 - How to find your voice -    
 
  Clear two things. 
           i) Find your Intention of writing (Sensitivity)  -  To inform, peruade, inspire, motivate, entertain. 
	ii) Find the audience to whom you want to convey the message. - Bussiness, newsletter, company staff, friends, personal blogs, 
	
	Intention + Audience = Content + Tone + Pace. 
			
 Example: Persuade a staff of paycut without making them leave the company. 		(80/100)
	      i)  Every single one of you continously put all your honest efforts for our organisation's success.
	ii) I am glad to have a team that stands together in all ups and downs.
	iii)There were times when we have enjoyed the success together. 
	iv) Being an integral part of the organisation you also understand that all seasons are not the same.
	v)  Our organisation is going through one of such bad seasons, which will pass for sure.
	vi) To keep the organisation up and running and overcome this downtime for better days, the management has decided to put minor reductions in the payrolls until we get the hold on the situation.
	vii) Along with this, the management requests each one of you to stay with us in this phase as you all are the core strengh of this family. Together we will win.
			 
			 
5 - Kickstart the narrative:  
  Process:
     - See writing as relevant points to convey.		 
	 - Organise the sentences and order them into a more sensible content, with the most suitable tone based on your intent and the audience you're covering.
	 
6 - How to ogranise the narrative:
     - Organisation creates flow. 
	 - Some points will relate to each other more. They may be speaking about one particular things. Group them.
	 - Which one will follow other better.
	 - You can elaborate, illustrate or even challange your points.	
	 - **Divide the whole narrative to different sections relating to one particular topic.
	 - Order of organizing point can follow this structure -- General point --> Elaboration of that point --> Being specific with examples(illustration) --> Challange it with       some      contradictory point.
	 
	 @Movie Review
	  Narrative structure #1  - Sections: Characters, dialogues, plot, pace, special effects.
	  Narrative structure #2 -  Sections: Things I like, Things I don't like.
	       Both these structures can be fitted into one another e.g., plot section can have likes and dislikes sub sections. Vice Versa
		   
		   
7 - Killer Start: 
     - Adding flair and flourishes to an unstructured piece of writing is like putting lipstic to the pig, focus on the structure first.
     - Get to the point at the start so that you can hold the reader. Do not ghumao the baat. Though, you can use anecdotal lead to enter the main structure.
	 - Start with a little drama.

8 - Cool kickers: Last sentence of the article.
     - To leave an impact
     - Do not repeat the words/sentence.
     - It must leverage the original intention of the writing. A nice little circle of message.
